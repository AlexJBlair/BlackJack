# BlackJack

Version: 0.0.1

Languages: C++

Summary:

This is a simple application which I hope to grow into a much larger one. It is the game of blackjack played via the player and the computer as the dealer. It mainly focuses on the object oriented programming paradigm, but feel free to make any changes you see fit for the betterment of the repo. Systems such as betting, all of the rules of blackjack and other crucial systems will be present. As it stands at the moment, this is just a console application, but a GUI will be able to be added in the future. Any feedback on software engineering styles and paradigms are welcome.
